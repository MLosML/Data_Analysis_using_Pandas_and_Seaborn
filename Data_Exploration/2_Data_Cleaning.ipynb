For example, if order number 175 contained 3 seperate products, then order 175 would have 3 rows in `orderlines`, one row for each of the products. If 2 of those products have 'normal' prices (14.99, 15.85) and 1 has a price with 2 decimal points (1.137.99), I need to remove the whole order and not just the affected row.
